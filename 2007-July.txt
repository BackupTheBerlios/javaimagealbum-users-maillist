Subject: [Javaimagealbum-users] can you double check the jai 1.1 uploads?
Message-ID: <13e802630707182339y11e889d8qa345fb6388a21d22@mail.gmail.com>

I've not heard back since July 3, so I thought maybe my first message
did not get through.  The version of the jai 1.1 jar file on the site
won't open for me, and I think perhaps the upload is not complete.  On
my end, I see:

[pauljohn at pols126 ~]$ ls -la javaimagealbum.jar
-rw-rw-r-- 1 pauljohn pauljohn 411559 2007-07-04 14:04 javaimagealbum.jar
[pauljohn at pols126 ~]$ java -jar javaimagealbum.jar
Invalid or corrupt jarfile javaimagealbum.jar

The size of the javaimagealbum.jar file matches the value on the web site...
